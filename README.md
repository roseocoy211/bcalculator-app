Learning experience/challenges:
This was my first time using GitHub, where I learned to upload, manage, and deploy the project on GitHub Pages. A challenge was figuring out how to get the live deployment link. Other challenges included ensuring the files worked together and getting familiar with GitHub.

This project helped me learn how to organize code into separate files in visual studio code, use GitHub, and deploy a project.
